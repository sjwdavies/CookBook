## Ingredients

- 100 g chicken breast, skinless, diced
- 100 g potato, peeled, chopped
- 60 g carrot, peeled, chopped
- 25 g leek, washed, sliced
- 50 g courgette, chopped
- 1 tsp olive oil, for sautéing
- 350 ml water, no stock cubes

## Method

1. Prepare all vegetables, chopping into small pieces suitable for the soup maker.
2. Add olive oil, then the chicken and all vegetables to the soup maker.
3. Pour in water to reach the minimum fill line.
4. Select the smooth soup or blend program and cook (~25 min).
5. Check texture — it should be soft and lightly blended.
6. If too thick, add a splash of boiled water and blend briefly.
7. Cool before serving; test temperature carefully before offering to Arthur.

## Notes

- Freeze in small portions or ice cube trays for up to 2 months.
- Defrost overnight in the fridge and reheat until piping hot, then cool before serving.
