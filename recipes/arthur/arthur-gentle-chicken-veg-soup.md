## Ingredients
- 100 g chicken breast (skinless, diced)
- 100 g potato (peeled, chopped)
- 60 g carrot (peeled, chopped)
- 25 g leek (washed, sliced)
- 50 g courgette (chopped)
- 1 tsp olive oil (for sautéing)
- 350 ml water (no stock cubes)
- pinch fresh parsley or thyme (optional aroma only)

## Method
- Prepare all vegetables, chopping into small pieces suitable for the soup maker.
- Add olive oil, then the chicken and all vegetables to the soup maker.
- Pour in water to reach the minimum fill line.
- Select the smooth soup or blend program and cook (~25 min).
- Check texture — it should be soft and lightly blended.
- If too thick, add a splash of boiled water and blend briefly.
- Cool before serving; test temperature carefully before offering to Arthur.

## Notes
- Freeze in small portions or ice cube trays for up to 2 months.
- Defrost overnight in the fridge and reheat until piping hot, then cool before serving.
- No salt, stock cubes, or honey.
- Batch-friendly and ideal for easy lunches.
