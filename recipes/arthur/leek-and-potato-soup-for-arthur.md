## Ingredients

- 1 tsp unsalted butter
- 50 g onion, finely chopped
- 200 g leek, white and light-green parts only, sliced
- 200 g potato, peeled and diced
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 500 ml low-salt vegetable stock, ≤ 0.1 g salt per 100 ml
- 50 ml double cream

## Method

1. Add butter, onion and garlic to the soup maker jug.
2. Use the sauté/quick cook function on low–medium heat for 3–4 minutes, stirring gently so nothing catches.
3. Add leek, potato and stock to the jug.
4. Select the Smooth Soup program; the machine will heat, cook and blend automatically (about 25 minutes).
5. When finished, open the lid, pour in the double cream, then blend briefly (5–10 seconds) to combine.
6. Check texture and add a splash of warm stock if you want it thinner.
7. Cool slightly before serving -- ensure it’s warm, not hot.

## Notes

- Use baby-safe, very low-salt stock only.
- Smooth soup cycle gives a velvety purée, ideal for 7–12 months.
- Store up to 2 days in the fridge or 1 month in the freezer. Reheat until piping hot, then cool before serving.
- Adults can season separately after portioning Arthur’s batch.
